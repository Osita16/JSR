    <h2>Process of Creating a 3D Model</h2>
    <p>
        Below are the detailed steps to generate an accurate 3D model of the building using AGI Metashape software:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Extract Frames from Video:</strong> The first step involves converting the video into multiple high-quality frames for detailed analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Align Frames:</strong> Use AGI Metashape to align the frames, ensuring that all captured angles seamlessly fit together.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Generate Dense Cloud:</strong> Create a dense cloud point to accurately capture the building's geometry and structure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Build Cloud Mesh:</strong> Develop a mesh structure from the dense cloud, forming the building's basic 3D representation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Texture Refinement:</strong> Refine the texture of the 3D model to enhance its visual appeal and make it as realistic as possible.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Results of the 3D Model Creation</h2>

    <h2>Advantages of 3D Modeling from Drone Footage</h2>
    <p>
        The use of drone footage and 3D modeling offers several benefits:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive Analysis:</strong> A 360° perspective provides detailed insights into every aspect of the building.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> The automated process significantly reduces the time required for manual measurements and modeling.</li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Advanced software like AGI Metashape ensures precise alignment and realistic texture mapping.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> The model can be used in urban planning, construction, forensic investigations, and more.</li>
        </ul>
